# Golden-Numbers

In Iran, phone numbers are usually priced according to different criteria. For people, it is important to have a number that is easy to read, as they see it as a factor of luxury. (So-called golden numbers)

So it is important for telecom companies to have the best price for each category of numbers so that they can increase their margin when selling SIM cards.

As a data scientist in a telecom company, my job is to predict the price of a SIM based on some defined metrics and criteria. These are some rules that are applied to a number to find its category and best price based on similar numbers currently in the market. (Data is for open market prices)

"So I use a deep neural network to predict the price. But first I have to create features from phone numbers".
